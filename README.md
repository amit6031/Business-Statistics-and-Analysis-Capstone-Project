This project aims to study housing affordability relative to Median Income, Poverty Level Income, Fair Market Rent, Housing costs, Household Income and various other variables/features. 
The data is used only for the years 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013.
The data can be downloaded from https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/hads/hads.html

The analysis of data is done in 3 parts, analysis of each part is done in different excel workbook:

Part 1: a) Identifying the differences in the Market Value of occupied vs vacant housing units over the period of 2005 through 2013 using t-test for difference in means.

Part 1: b) Comparing Fair Market Rent (FMR) values across different years using Paired t-test for difference in means.

Part 2: Using Regression Analysis to identify important factors (out of various factors) that affect "Current Market Value" for the year 2013. Various Regression models were built with various combinations of factors and the best model was chosen on the basis of R-square value.

Part 3: Predicting the "Current Market value" for the year 2013 by using the data of the year 2011 using Regression Analysis.
